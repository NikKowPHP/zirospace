Hello @roo,

I need your assistance in processing and planning the execution of the following TODO list for the "[**User: Insert Project Name Here**]" project.

**Your Task:**

For each TODO item listed below, please:

1.  **Acknowledge & Understand:** Briefly confirm your understanding of the task's objective.
2.  **Breakdown (if necessary):** If the task is complex, break it down into smaller, manageable sub-steps.
3.  **Identify Affected Components:** Based on the provided project context (and any general knowledge you have), list the primary files, classes, functions, or modules that you anticipate will need to be created or modified to complete this task.
4.  **Outline Implementation Approach:** Describe the general strategy or steps you would take to implement the solution. Be specific enough to show a clear path forward. (e.g., "Fetch data from X API endpoint, then transform it by Y, then update Z component in the UI.")
5.  **Identify Potential Challenges/Dependencies:** Note any potential roadblocks, dependencies on other tasks (either in this list or external), or information you might need clarified.
6.  **Consider Edge Cases/Testing (Briefly):** Mention 1-2 key edge cases or testing considerations for this task.
7.  **(Optional) Estimate Relative Effort:** If possible, give a very rough qualitative estimate of effort (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) compared to other tasks in this list.

After processing all individual TODOs, please provide:

8.  **Suggested Order of Execution:** If there's a logical or dependent order in which these tasks should be tackled, please suggest it.

    *   [**User: Provide snippets from an XML context file or list relevant file paths/structures, e.g.:**
        ```xml
        <project name="WebApp">
