# Rules for Following Todo Lists

When a todo list is provided in this file, I will follow these rules:

1.  **Read and Understand:** I will read the provided todo list carefully to understand the features or tasks that need to be implemented.
2.  **Search for Existing Implementations:** I will use the `search_files` tool to search the project files for any existing code or comments related to the todo list items. This helps in identifying already completed tasks or existing relevant code.
3.  **Plan Implementation:** Based on the todo list and the search results, I will plan the implementation steps for each item.
4.  **Implement Features:** I will use the available tools (`read_file`, `write_to_file`, `replace_in_file`, `execute_command`, etc.) to implement the features or complete the tasks listed in the todo list.
5.  **Mark as Implemented:** Once I am confident that a todo list item has been fully implemented and tested (if applicable), I will mark it as completed in this file. I will use the following format to mark a completed item: `- [x] Todo item description`.
