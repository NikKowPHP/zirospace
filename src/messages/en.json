        "answer": "A one-page website is a single webpage that contains all essential information about your business or project. It's perfect for simple presentations, landing pages, or when you want to guide visitors through a specific narrative flow. All content is organized in sections that users can scroll through or navigate to using menu links."

        "question": "What are the benefits of a multi-page website?",
        "answer": "Multi-page websites offer more detailed content organization, better SEO opportunities, and are ideal for complex businesses. They allow for deeper content hierarchies, dedicated sections for different services or products, and can grow with your business. They're particularly effective for content-rich sites and e-commerce platforms."
      },
      "timeline": {
        "question": "How long does it take to design and develop a website?",
