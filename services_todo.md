- [ ] Write component tests for `ServiceList` in `src/app/(admin)/admin/sections/services/service-list.tsx`.
- [ ] Write component tests for `ServiceForm` in `src/app/(admin)/admin/sections/services/components/service-form.tsx`.
- [ ] Implement server-side sanitization for `contentHtml` and `excerpt` from Quill editor before saving in service creation/update logic.
- [ ] Enhance `ServiceForm` `keywords` input to use a tag-input component for better usability.
- [ ] Write component tests for the create service page in `src/app/(admin)/admin/sections/services/create/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Write component tests for the edit service page in `src/app/(admin)/admin/sections/services/edit/[id]/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Update the placeholder "URL TO ZIROSPACE LOGO" in `src/app/[locale]/services/[slug]/page.tsx` JSON-LD to use a dynamic and correct logo URL.
